## Description
I use this project to source photos of basketball players.

## Usage

```node index.js```

That will create a folder called `teams` containing a sub-folder for each professional team. Each sub-folder will contain a `.png` of each player on the roster, and a `team.json` file containing information about the players in that folder.

## NOTICE
I do not work for the NBA or any affiliates. While this *sample* project uses data and assets from publicly available web properties, trademarks, copyrights, and intellectual property rights remain intact.

I use the results of this project privately.
